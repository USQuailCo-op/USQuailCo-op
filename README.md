- 👋 Hi, we are the US Quail Cooperative @USQuailCo-op
- 👀 I’m interested in developing useful widgets and tools to help US Quail Farmers buy and sell Coturninx and Bobwhite quail, as well as create a concerted voice to increase market options for homestead farmers
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Claude 3.5, NotebookLM and Bolt.ned to create implement the Brilliant Directories (BD) opensource platform and customizing widgets to implement functionality on the USQuailCoop.com and USQuail.com website
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building "BD" widgets such as a custom BD nested Affiliate Mamagement portal, an automated email account interface for users to create an @QuailMail.US email address and USQUail themed email client, a "QuailTV" Podcast portal and programming scheduler, Sidebar Covey Calculator for buyers to calculate the cost estimate and number of hatching eggs or live chicks to buy to achieve a desired number of eggs per day that can be emailed to a selected member within the directory, and a more functional integration with google maps to only show member contact details to logged in patron visitors

- ⚡ Fun fact: Coturnix Quail are a staple diet in most of Asia and many European countries, but have not yet been allowed to compete in the US markets due to large poultry businesses monopolizing the industry.  Quail are more nutritious, can be raised on a nonGMO diet and are mRNA vaccine free, and have immunological benefits such as vascular tissue repair due to high selenium content of the meat and eggs (heart, lungs, blood).  They are less susceptible to disease, require a small footprint to grow and thrive in caged environments (unlike chicken or even Bobwhite Quail), making them an ideal resource to "Grow your own protein!"
